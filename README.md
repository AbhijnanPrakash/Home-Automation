# Internet of Things

The Internet of Things (IoT) is changing how we live, work, travel, and do business. It is even the basis of a new industrial transformation, known as Industry 4.0, 
and key in the digital transformation of organizations, cities, and society overall. IoT is an umbrella term with many use cases, technologies, standards and 
applications. Moreover, itâ€™s the term for a broad range of underlying technologies and services, which depend on the use cases and in turn are part of a broader 
technology ecosystem. It includes several related technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, next-gen cybersecurity, advanced analytics, big data,
various connectivity/communication technologies, digital twin simulation, augmented andvirtual reality, blockchain and more.The things and data are the starting point 
and essence of what IoT enables and means. IoT devices and assets are equipped with electronics, such as sensors and actuators, connectivity/communication electronics 
and software to capture, filter and exchange data about themselves, their state and their environment.

Home automation  is building automation for a home, called a smart home or smart house. A home automation system will control lighting, climate,entertainment systems, 
and appliances. It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems. When connected with the Internet, home devices are an important 
constituent of the Internet of Things ("IoT"). A home automation system typically connects controlled devices to a central hub or "gateway". The user interface for 
control of the system uses either wall-mounted terminals, tablet or desktop computers, a mobile phone application, or a Web interface, that may also be accessible 
off-site through the Internet.

Controlling home appliances like bulb, fan, Mixer grinder, fridge,etc from your device via Bluetooth. 
This project can be built using Arduino. Using the code and rigging up the circuit as shown in the circuit diagram , appliances at
your home can be controlled using bluetooth.
